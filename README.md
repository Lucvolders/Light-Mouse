# Light-Mouse
Using LDR's on an Arduino for moving the mousepointer on your computer

This is a complete setup to turn an Arduino Pro Micro into a mouse for your computer or Raspberry.

Attach 4 LDR's to the analogue inputs of the arduino and moving your hand above them makes the mousepointer on your screen move.
